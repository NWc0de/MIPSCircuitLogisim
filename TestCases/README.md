This directory contains test cases for each operation specified by the the MIPS assignment. Each folder contains all materials necessary to test the respective operations. The only convention necessary to the operations to work is that which is specified by the assignment (0x40 must be in register 1).

In addition to individual test cases a comprehensive test file is also included which tests the operations together.
